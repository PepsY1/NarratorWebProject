I do not claim to have designed the program that uses the API keys, but had to go through extensive efforts to make the system work by creating the keys.

Currently, you cannot launch the program without supplying it with API keys, which have expired as of 01/05/2024.

The web design was done solely by me, including the ability to upload images.

The original program allowed the program to narrate the input of a web camera, however I designed this as a personal tool for use with my friends and therefore supplying images via an upload system was more usable, therefore I had to alter the code to permit this functionality.

One standard test audio can be found in the following directory of the project:
narrator-main\narrationweb

This audio was done when supplied an image of a sauna. All of my other audio clips involved me and my friends, which I do not wish to share for personal reasons and I hope this adjustment in providing evidence of the program working can be understood.
